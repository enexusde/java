This plug-in for Eclipse let a Link in a browser open a file in eclipse at a specific line / selection.

Example:
If you have a Project called "Test". Inside the Project you have a file "readme.txt" containing 3 lines. You can use this link to open the file and select the whole line 2 by this URL: http://localhost
